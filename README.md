## Play that choon!! 

Welcome to Team CNZ's hackathon project built using React.

## Overview: The challenge

~ To build something meaningful using the skills weâ€™ve learned during web engineering week on React

## Getting started

Once you have cloned the repo, use `npm install` to install the dependencies. The deployed version of the app can be found here: https://trying-nu.vercel.app/  

## Team Approach

We decided as a team that we would like to have a theme around the random song picker that would pick a song for the School of Code Bootcampers, with the addition of embedding the video into the app.

## Planning Phase

For our initial ideation and planning, we used Figma. We started throwing round ideas around theme and what tools we would like to use. We then used a voting system similar to dot voting to decide priorities. We ussed github kanban board and issues to track progress

## MVPs

Once we settled on what we wanted the app to do, we set about drawing a fat marker version of the design, the component list and component tree and then writing our MVPs:

MVP 1
Create homepage playing embedded video
MVP 2
Add song selector
MVP 3
Create functionality to add songs
MVP 4
Play random song
MVP 5
Create a carousel 
MVP 6
Host and client platforms for the School of Code session

## Challenges

Initial challenges we came accross were how exactly to embed a video using React, and questions over how exactly to access the song data: set up a database and a server then fetch the data using an API or hard code the data. Due to time constraints, we decided to hard code but we would move to an external database as the next step. 
During build, we had issues trying to have the 'random song' button as a card along with the other song cards. We would instead have it as a 'random song' button separate from the song cards. 

## Learning Points

Using ready built components - such as those for the video card and the form, taken from Material UI - take time intially to be incorporated into your code. A robust and clear file structure is essential for ease of navigation. We would have liked to incorporate testing.
